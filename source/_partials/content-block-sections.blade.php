			<p>
				I'm a full stack web developer who does PHP and Javascript and dabbles in design.<br>
				Particularly well versed in building large CMS ( e.g Wordpress ) backed websites with custom integrations, and Ionic Framework for mobile apps. <br>
				But have worked with much more - Codigniter, OpenCart, React Native, SASS etc.<br> 
				I believe in choosing the tech appropriate to the project. <br>
				and am a human being with integrity.
